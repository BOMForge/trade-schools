# Hex Grid Debugging Guide

## Issue Fixed

The hex grid was not working due to potential H3.js library loading race conditions and missing error handling. The following improvements have been implemented:

## Changes Made

### 1. H3 Library Load Detection
Added initialization wait function that ensures H3.js is fully loaded before attempting to render:

```javascript
function initializeWhenReady() {
    if (typeof h3 === 'undefined') {
        console.log('Waiting for H3 library to load...');
        setTimeout(initializeWhenReady, 100);
        return;
    }
    console.log('✅ H3 library loaded successfully');
    // ... continue initialization
}
```

### 2. Library Availability Check
Added validation at the start of `addHexGridToMap()`:

```javascript
if (typeof h3 === 'undefined') {
    console.error('H3 library not loaded! Cannot render hex grid.');
    alert('Error: H3 mapping library failed to load. Please refresh the page.');
    return;
}
```

### 3. Coordinate Validation
Validates school coordinates before processing:

```javascript
if (!school.lat || !school.lon || isNaN(parseFloat(school.lat)) || isNaN(parseFloat(school.lon))) {
    console.warn('Invalid coordinates for school:', school.name);
    return;
}
```

### 4. Comprehensive Error Tracking
Added counters to track success and failures at each stage:

- **Aggregation Phase**: Tracks schools successfully added to hex bins vs errors
- **Rendering Phase**: Tracks hex cells successfully rendered vs errors
- **Final Validation**: Alerts user if no cells were rendered

### 5. Enhanced Console Logging
All operations now log detailed information:

```
Creating hex grid with resolution 4 for 989 schools
Hex aggregation: 989 schools successful, 0 errors
Created 234 hex cells with enhanced metrics
✅ Hex grid rendered: 234 cells successful, 0 errors
```

## How to Debug Hex Grid Issues

### Step 1: Open Browser Developer Console

**Chrome/Edge**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
**Firefox**: Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac)  
**Safari**: Press `Cmd+Option+C`

### Step 2: Look for Error Messages

Check the console for these key messages:

#### ✅ **Success Messages** (Everything Working)
```
✅ H3 library loaded successfully
Creating hex grid with resolution 4 for 989 schools
Hex aggregation: 989 schools successful, 0 errors
Created 234 hex cells with enhanced metrics
✅ Hex grid rendered: 234 cells successful, 0 errors
```

#### ⚠️ **Warning Messages** (Partial Failure)
```
Waiting for H3 library to load...
Invalid coordinates for school: [name]
Failed to get H3 index for: [name]
```

#### ❌ **Error Messages** (Complete Failure)
```
H3 library not loaded! Cannot render hex grid.
⚠️ No hex cells created! Check if schools have valid coordinates.
❌ No hex cells were rendered! Check browser console for errors.
Failed to create hex cell: [h3Index] [error]
```

### Step 3: Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "H3 library not loaded"
**Cause**: H3.js failed to download or is blocked  
**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Disable browser extensions that might block scripts
3. Check if you're behind a firewall/proxy blocking unpkg.com
4. Try hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) / `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

#### Issue: "No hex cells created"
**Cause**: School data has invalid coordinates  
**Solutions**:
1. Check if CSV data loaded: Look for "✅ Geocoded data loaded" in console
2. Verify CSV has valid lat/lon columns
3. Check if filters are too restrictive (no schools match)
4. Clear filters and try again

#### Issue: "Hex grid rendered: 0 cells successful"
**Cause**: H3 API errors during rendering  
**Solutions**:
1. Check for specific error messages about which h3 function failed
2. Verify H3.js version is 4.1.0 (check script tag in HTML)
3. Try zooming in/out to change resolution
4. Refresh the page

#### Issue: Hex grid renders but looks wrong
**Cause**: Data aggregation or color blending issues  
**Solutions**:
1. Check "Created X hex cells" count - should be reasonable for zoom level
2. Click on hexagons to see popup data
3. Try different zoom levels (changes H3 resolution automatically)
4. Check if legend colors match hexagon colors

### Step 4: Test the Fix

1. **Refresh the page** with console open
2. **Wait** for initialization messages
3. **Click "Hex Grid" button** if not already active
4. **Verify** you see hexagons on the map
5. **Zoom in/out** to verify dynamic resolution changes work
6. **Click hexagons** to verify popups show data

## Technical Details

### H3 Resolution by Zoom Level

| Zoom Level | H3 Resolution | Hex Size |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| ≤ 3 | 2 | ~12,392 km² |
| 4-5 | 3 | ~1,770 km² |
| 6-7 | 4 | ~253 km² |
| 8-9 | 5 | ~36 km² |
| 10-11 | 6 | ~5.2 km² |
| ≥ 12 | 7 | ~0.7 km² |

### H3.js v4 API Methods Used

- `h3.latLngToCell(lat, lon, resolution)` - Converts coordinates to H3 index
- `h3.cellToBoundary(h3Index, true)` - Gets hexagon boundary for rendering
- `h3.cellToLatLng(h3Index)` - Gets center point of hexagon

### Expected Performance

- **989 schools** should create **~200-500 hex cells** depending on zoom level
- **Aggregation** should take < 100ms
- **Rendering** should take < 500ms
- **Total** hex grid creation should complete in < 1 second

## Reporting Issues

If hex grid still doesn't work after following this guide:

1. **Copy console output** (all messages)
2. **Note browser** and version (e.g., Chrome 120)
3. **Describe steps** taken before error
4. **Include screenshot** of map and console
5. **Report** with above information

## Files Modified

- `src/map.html` - Added H3 loading detection, validation, error handling, and comprehensive logging

## Verification Checklist

- [x] H3.js library loading is verified before use
- [x] Coordinate validation prevents invalid data
- [x] Error tracking at aggregation phase
- [x] Error tracking at rendering phase
- [x] User alerts for complete failures
- [x] Detailed console logging for debugging
- [x] No silent failures
- [x] Graceful degradation with error messages
