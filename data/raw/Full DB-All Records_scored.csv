We’re proud to say that it’s all we know. Whether we’re working on a government contract, a critical aerospace component or any number of other precision requirements, our commitment to quality never changes. As evidence of this commitment, consider our continuing conformance to the Quality Program Requirement of MIL-Q-9858A. We are equally proud of our ability to balance the requirements of precision manufacturing with cost efficiency. This is amply displayed by our continued success in the manufacturing of Aerospace, Defense, Military and Commercial Firearm Components, Ammunition, Projectiles and Medical Parts and Components - fields that simultaneously demand close tolerances and economical unit cost. We assure precision production right from the start by designing and producing our own special tooling, fixtures and gauges in-house. This gives AO Precision a substantial edge when meeting tight production deadlines with equally tight cost requirements. Our CNC machining centers, lathes and grinders have produced an impressive array of items machined from a wide range of carbon and stainless steels, aluminum, titanium, plus many of the “super-alloys”. In addition, we maintain in-house resources for stamping, welding and broaching, as well as machining many plastics and phenolic resin compounds. Small or large in size, simple or complex in design, short run or large quantities; if precision, delivery and cost are all critical AO Precision manufacturing is your source. Solving application problems and dedicated engineering expertise are admirable qualities, but without the manufacturing capabilities to back them up, they don t mean much to the customer. With four companies under one umbrella we at At AO Precision understand the synergy of all aspects of the product development cycle which is why we place extraordinary emphasis on our manufacturing processes. With over 300,000 square feet, translating to capacity in excess of 100,000 man hours per month and 4 plant locations, precision machining, stamping and fabrication, machined medical parts and ammunition and projectiles, we at AO have made manufacturing a way of life. To meet our customers varied applications and stringent time requirements, we have invested heavily in the most advanced equipment and software available today. We’ve integrated all our N/C equipment to a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system to ensure exact tolerances (± .00015 on full travel and repeating accuracy with up to 14,000 r.p.m. spindle speeds) and a more cost-effective throughput. Our closed-loop MRP II manufacturing software generates material and manufacturing requirements automatically from order entry. And to meet JIT delivery commitments, our work centers are capacity-loaded and can simulate capacity levels prior to actual order receipt. AO also provides total turnkey assembly operations and we pride ourselves on performing all assembly operations in-house under our direct control.

With a commitment to quality and advanced manufacturing capabilities, they are well-positioned to meet the demands of the industry.",Engage Trio Manufacturing with a tailored outreach highlighting potential collaboration opportunities in aerospace projects.,"Trio Manufacturing, Inc.",www.trulok.com.,"El Segundo, California",Job Shop / Contract Manufacturer,75.0,"Fabrication,Machining,Sheet Metal","Trio Manufacturing is a 64-year-old family business that began when its founder, Samuel Rinsler, made the courageous decision to leave steady employment with a major aerospace and defense company and embarked on his entrepreneurial journey. While evaluating his former employer's processes, he conceived one of the world's first mechanical countersink gages. Along with two co-workers he left the large firm and nurtured his concept to fruition. Eventually, the 3 partners went their separate ways and Trio became a bona-fide family owned business that has been under the management of three generations of the same dedicated family. The family has grown the initial product to become the gold standard for fastener related measurement by all of the world's leading commercial and military aircraft companies. Trio continues to manufacture the complete line of Trulok measuring instruments which can be viewed at www.trulok.com.
















  By 1960, Trio had firmly established itself as a world class builder of precision gages. This reputation led to Trio being invited to bid on machined flight parts and assemblies from companies such as McDonnell Douglas, Hughes and Menasco. One job led to another, and Trio quickly built a name as a first rate supplier of close tolerance parts. By 1965, Trio launched its contract manufacturing division to support the burgeoning Southern California aerospace industry.









  After Mr. Rinsler’s passing in 1994, his grandchildren, Michael and Brian Hunkins embarked on a major exspansion that the founder would be proud of. This growth resulted in the acquisition of state-of-the-art machinery , additional manpower and a move to a larger facility in El Segundo California. By 1997, Trio had outgrown its building which required it to move to its present home, a 40,000 square foot state of the art facility.









  Trio has continued to make considerable investments in the latest machine tool technology as evidenced by the 2011 opening of our high production wing. It features multiple palletized and multi access machining centers for lights out production of entire part families. Our commitment to upholding the high standard set by our founder has not wavered and we look forward to next chapter in our illustrious history.









  With more than 60 years of manufacturing experience, TRIO knows what it takes to consistently provide our valued customers with high quality parts and assemblies. Our strong discipline of quality control, coupled with the specialized skills of our manufacturing methods and technology allows us to meet and exceed your expectations. Call us today to find out why TRIO is the dependable supplier you've been looking for!

THERMOFORMING One of the main advantages of using thermoforming is that it’s very adaptable to all of your project needs. Thermoforming has quick turnaround times and can be a great tool for providing prototypes, saving you time and money. WELDING MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the work piece, making it ideal for joining dissimilar materials. This process is commonly used for sheet metal, steel structures, and automotive components. Commonly used materials for MIG welding include carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, magnesium, copper, nickel, silicon bronze, and other alloys. TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding is a non-consumable electrode welding method, therefore the tungsten doesn’t get consumed with the process. This allows for a higher degree of control resulting in very clean welds. TIG welding is commonly used in automotive, aerospace, and auto body repairs. Applicable materials for TIG include aluminum, copper, magnesium, titanium, nickel, and other non-ferrous metals. Stick Welding, also known as Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), is the most widely used of the various arc welding processes. Stick welding is very versatile in respect to its environment as it can be used indoors, outdoors, and in remote areas. Materials commonly used include steel, stainless steel, cast iron, or aluminum."

His earliest business venture was founded in 1889 as the Mossberg Wrench Company, and initially was a maker of tools for the jeweler's trade. In the early 1890s the company began producing several styles of adjustable bicycle wrenches, a type of tool very popular at the time. In 1899 Frank Mossberg and other investors founded the Frank Mossberg Company to manufacture tools, and the company began production of pipe wrenches, bicycle wrenches, and related tools. The expansion of the automobile industry created great demand for automotive service tools, and in the years from 1910 to 1920 the Frank Mossberg Company became a significant maker of automotive specialty tools. These tools consisted primarily of fixed socket wrenches in many shapes and sizes, and Mossberg was probably second only to Walden-Worcester as a producer of such tools. During the 1920s the company continued to expand its automotive service tools line. In 1927 the company was reorganized as the APCO-Mossberg Company, by merger with APCO. The APCO-Mossberg name is still one synonymous with high quality and superior customer service."
