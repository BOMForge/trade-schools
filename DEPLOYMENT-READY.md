```

## ⚠️ What's NOT Built Yet (Future Enhancement)

### Individual School Detail Pages
**Current State:**
- ❌ No dedicated URLs for individual schools (e.g., `/schools/lincoln-tech-denver.html`)
- ❌ Schools only visible via:
  - Map markers and popups
  - Sidebar school cards
  - State page listings
  - Direct website links

**Why This Matters for SEO:**
- Google cannot index individual schools
- No deep links to share specific schools
- Limited SEO value from 1,033 schools
- No rich snippets for individual institutions

**Future Implementation Needed:**
1. Generate static HTML for each school OR
2. Use dynamic routing with query params (e.g., `/school-detail.html?id=123`)
3. Add school detail pages to sitemap
4. Implement proper breadcrumbs and structured data

**Template Exists:**
- `school-detail.html` template is ready but not wired up to actual schools
- Has proper SEO meta tags and structured data placeholders

## 🎯 SEO & Crawl Paths Summary

### ✅ Currently Crawlable (57 pages):
1. **Main pages (7):** Fully indexed, linked from navigation
2. **State pages (50):** Fully indexed, linked from states.html directory
3. **Submit form:** Crawlable but likely excluded from index (form page)

### ⚠️ NOT Crawlable Yet:
- **Individual schools (1,033):** No dedicated URLs
- **Recommendation:** Build individual school pages for massive SEO boost

### Crawl Path Example:
```
Homepage (/)
  └─ Browse by State link
       └─ States Directory (states.html)
            └─ California link
                 └─ California State Page (states/california.html)
                      └─ Schools listed but NO individual page links ⚠️
```
