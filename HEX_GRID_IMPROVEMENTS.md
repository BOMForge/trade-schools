# 🗺️ Hex Grid Aggregation Improvements

## Overview
Significantly enhanced the H3 hex grid aggregation system in `clean-map.html` with advanced data summarization, multi-program visualization, and comprehensive analytics.

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. **Upgraded H3 Library** ✅
- **From:** H3.js v3.7.2 (old API)
- **To:** H3.js v4.1.0 (modern API with better performance)
- **Benefits:**
  - Faster hex cell calculations
  - More accurate boundary rendering
  - Better browser compatibility
  - Updated API calls:
    - `h3.geoToH3()` → `h3.latLngToCell()`
    - `h3.h3ToGeoBoundary()` → `h3.cellToBoundary()`
    - `h3.h3ToGeo()` → `h3.cellToLatLng()`

### 2. **Enhanced Aggregation Algorithm** ✅
- **New Metrics Calculated:**
  - **School Count:** Total schools in each hex
  - **Program Instances:** Total program offerings (schools can offer multiple)
  - **Unique Programs:** Number of distinct programs
  - **Average Programs per School:** Calculated ratio
  - **Program Distribution:** Top 5 programs with counts and percentages
  - **Program Diversity Score:** Shannon entropy calculation (0-4 scale)

- **Shannon Entropy Formula:**
  ```
  H = -Σ(p_i * log2(p_i))
  where p_i = count_i / total_count
  ```
  - High diversity (>2.5): Very diverse program offerings
  - Moderate (1.0-2.5): Balanced mix
  - Low (<1.0): Specialized/focused area

### 3. **Multi-Program Color Visualization** ✅
Hexagons now use intelligent color blending instead of single dominant color:

#### Color Strategy:
- **Single Dominant (≥70%):** Pure program color
- **Two Programs (50-69%):** Blended gradient of top 2
- **High Diversity (<50%):** Multi-color blend of top 3 programs

#### Visual Enhancements:
- **Hex Fill:** Blended color representing program composition
- **Border Badge:** Multi-color pie-wedge style border showing top 3 programs
  - 3+ programs: Conic gradient border
  - 2 programs: Dual-layer border
  - 1 program: Single color accent
- **Diversity Indicator Icons:**
  - 🌈 Very High diversity (>2.5)
  - ◐ Moderate diversity (>1.5)
  - (none) Specialized

### 4. **Comprehensive Popup Analytics** ✅
Each hex now displays rich statistical information:

#### Header Section:
- Resolution level indicator
- Total school count badge
- Visual hex symbol

#### Metrics Grid (3 columns):
- **Schools:** Total count
- **Programs:** Unique program types
- **Avg/School:** Average programs per school

#### Dominant Program Card:
- Crown icon indicator
- Program name
- School count and market share percentage
- Gradient background based on program color

#### Program Diversity Panel:
- Diversity score label (Very High/High/Moderate/Low)
- Visual progress bar
- Color-coded by diversity level

#### Program Distribution Chart:
- Top 5 programs shown
- Horizontal bar charts with percentages
- Color-coded bars matching program colors
- School counts displayed

#### Schools List:
- Up to 15 schools shown
- Left border color-coded by school's primary program
- City name in parentheses
- Scrollable list
- "X more schools" footer if >15

### 5. **Improved Resolution System** ✅
Enhanced zoom-based resolution with better granularity:

```javascript
Zoom 0-3:  Resolution 2  (~12,392 km² per hex)  - Continental
Zoom 4-5:  Resolution 3  (~1,770 km²)           - Multi-state
Zoom 6-7:  Resolution 4  (~253 km²)             - State level
Zoom 8-9:  Resolution 5  (~36 km²)              - Metro area
Zoom 10-11: Resolution 6 (~5.2 km²)             - City level
Zoom 12+:   Resolution 7 (~0.7 km²)             - Neighborhood
```

## 📊 New Data Insights Available

Users can now answer questions like:
1. **Which areas have the most diverse program offerings?** (Diversity score + icon)
2. **What's the program composition in this region?** (Top 5 with percentages)
3. **How specialized vs. diverse is each area?** (Diversity label + visual bar)
4. **What's the market share of each program?** (Percentage calculations)
5. **How many programs does the average school offer?** (Avg/School metric)
6. **Which specific schools are in this hex?** (Expandable school list)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Helper Functions:

1. **Color Blending:**
   ```javascript
   hexToRgb(hex)                    // Convert hex to RGB
   rgbToHex(r, g, b)                // Convert RGB to hex
   blendColors(color1, color2, ratio) // Blend two colors
   blendMultipleColors(colorWeights) // Weighted blend of 3+ colors
   ```

2. **Statistical Calculations:**
   ```javascript
   calculateDiversity(programs)     // Shannon entropy
   getTopPrograms(programs, n)      // Top N with percentages
   ```

3. **Enhanced Resolution:**
   ```javascript
   getH3Resolution()                // Zoom-based resolution (now 7 levels)
   ```
