## 🎯 Your Question Answered

### Q: Do we need to prompt AI to enrich our data to get it geocoded to work?

### A: **NO** for basic maps. **YES** for production quality.

| Scenario | Use AI? | Success Rate | Cost | Time |
|----------|---------|--------------|------|------|
| **Demo/Prototype** | ❌ No | 85-90% | FREE | 20 min |
| **Production/External** | ✅ Yes | 95-98% | $5-10 | 2 hours |

**Your built-in geocoding works great without AI.** Add AI enrichment later if you need production polish.

## 🚦 Choose Your Path

### Path A: I Need Maps TODAY
```bash
python tradeschool-analysis.py
# Wait 20 min → Use trade_schools_geocoded.csv
```
**Result:** 85-90% geocoding success  
**Good for:** Prototypes, internal demos

### Path B: I Need Production Quality
```bash
# Step 1: Get API key from console.anthropic.com
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key

# Step 2: Install AI enrichment
pip install anthropic

# Step 3: Clean addresses
python ai-data-enrichment.py trade_schools_curated.csv

# Step 4: Run analysis
python tradeschool-analysis.py
```
**Result:** 95-98% geocoding success

## 🔧 Customization

### Skip Geocoding (Faster Analysis Only)
Edit line 662 in `tradeschool-analysis.py`:
```python
enable_geocoding = False  # Default: True
```

### Process Subset (Testing)
Edit line 692 in `tradeschool-analysis.py`:
```python
df_to_geocode = pd.read_csv(unified_path).head(100)  # Test with 100
```

### Change Geocoding Provider
Replace `geocode_with_nominatim()` function (line 493) with:
- Google Maps Geocoding API
- Mapbox Geocoding API
- Here Geocoding API
- Your own geocoding service

---

## 🐛 Common Issues

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Geocoding is slow"
**Normal!** Nominatim free tier = 1 request/second.  
First run: ~20 min. Re-runs: instant (cached).

### "Some addresses failed to geocode"
Check `trade_schools_geocoded.csv`, filter `geocoded==False`.  
Options:
1. Accept 85-90% success (good for most use cases)
2. Run AI enrichment for 95%+ success
3. Manually fix failed addresses and re-run

### "API key error" (AI enrichment only)
```bash
# Get key from: https://console.anthropic.com
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
```

## ✅ Your Next 3 Steps

### 1. Run the Analysis (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/tc/workspace/TradeSchools/schools
pip install pandas numpy requests
python tradeschool-analysis.py
```

### 2. Check the Output (2 minutes)
```bash
ls -lh *.csv *.json
head trade_schools_geocoded.csv
```

### 3. Build Your First Map (1 hour)
- Open `MAP-READY-GUIDE.md`
- Choose Map #1, #2, or #3
- Follow the code examples

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always keep `geocode_cache.pkl`** - Deleting it means re-geocoding everything
2. **Start with Map #3** - Easiest to build (state choropleth + your ROI data)
3. **Filter `geocoded==True`** - Before mapping, remove failed geocodes
4. **Test with 100 schools first** - Use `.head(100)` to validate workflow
5. **Version your outputs** - Save dated copies: `trade_schools_geocoded_2024-10-28.csv`

---

## 🎯 Decision Matrix

### Choose Basic Geocoding If:
- ✅ Building prototype or proof-of-concept
- ✅ Internal use only
- ✅ Need results today
- ✅ 85-90% accuracy is acceptable
- ✅ Budget = $0

### Add AI Enrichment If:
- ✅ Production or customer-facing
- ✅ External presentations
- ✅ Need professional polish
- ✅ 95%+ accuracy required
- ✅ Budget allows $5-10

---

## 🚀 Bottom Line

**You're ready to build maps RIGHT NOW.**

Your `tradeschool-analysis.py` script already has geocoding built-in. Just run it:

```bash
python tradeschool-analysis.py
```

After 20 minutes, you'll have `trade_schools_geocoded.csv` with lat/lon for 85-90% of schools.

AI enrichment is **optional** and only needed if you want production-quality (95%+) for external use.
